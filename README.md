Project Overview
In this project, I tackled the challenging task of predicting rainfall patterns by employing various machine learning techniques and methodologies. The project workflow includes data exploration, preprocessing, balancing, splitting, normalization, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

Project Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted comprehensive univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
Gained insights into the dataset's structure and relationships between variables.
2. Data Preprocessing
Duplicate Removal: Ensured data integrity by dropping duplicate rows.
Missing Values: Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
Label Encoding: Converted categorical features into numerical representations.
Outlier Removal: Identified and removed outliers to enhance model robustness.
3. Data Balancing
Implemented undersampling techniques to address class imbalance, ensuring the model's ability to generalize effectively.
4. Data Splitting
Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to accurately assess model performance.
5. Normalization
Applied Min-Max scaling to normalize features, ensuring uniformity in data distribution and aiding in model convergence.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Utilized GridSearchCV to fine-tune the hyperparameters of several models:
KNeighborsClassifier
SVC
LogisticRegression
DecisionTreeClassifier
RandomForestClassifier
GradientBoostingClassifier
7. Model Training and Evaluation
